# yatl-python

Version: 0.2.2

A Python implementation of üêô YATL (Yet Another Tentacle Language) for defining and managing state machines.

## Introduction

YATL (Yet Another Tentacle Language) is an innovative, octopus-themed markup language designed specifically for defining and managing state machines. This Python package provides tools to parse, compile, validate, and execute YATL workflows.

## Installation

```bash
pip install yatl-python
```

## Features

- YATL Parser: Converts YATL syntax into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- YATL Compiler: Transforms the YATL AST into executable code
- YATL Validator: Checks YATL files for syntax and semantic correctness
- YATL Runtime: Executes the compiled YATL workflows

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use yatl-python:

```python
from yatl.parser import YATLParser
from yatl.compiler import YATLCompiler
from yatl.validator import YATLValidator
from yatl.runtime import YATLRuntime

# YATL content
yatl_content = """
name: SimpleWorkflow
description: "A simple workflow example"
initial_state: Start

states:
  Start:
    type: task
    action: sayHello
    next: Middle

  Middle:
    type: task
    action: sayWorking
    next: End

  End:
    type: task
    action: sayGoodbye
    next: null

actions:
  sayHello:
    description: "Say hello"
    language: python
    code: |
      print("Hello!")

  sayWorking:
    description: "Say working"
    language: python
    code: |
      print("Working...")

  sayGoodbye:
    description: "Say goodbye"
    language: python
    code: |
      print("Goodbye!")

variables:
  dummy: string
"""

# Parse YATL
parser = YATLParser()
parsed_yatl = parser.parse(yatl_content)

# Validate YATL
validator = YATLValidator()
if not validator.validate(parsed_yatl):
    print("Validation errors:", validator.errors)
    exit(1)

# Compile YATL
compiler = YATLCompiler()
compiled_yatl = compiler.compile(parsed_yatl)

# Execute YATL
runtime = YATLRuntime(compiled_yatl)
runtime.execute()
```

## Advanced Features

YATL supports various state types and control structures:

- Task States
- Choice States
- Loop States
- Parallel States
- End States
- Fail States

For more detailed examples and usage of these features, please refer to the [docs](docs/) directory.
